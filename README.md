MosquitoAI is an innovative initiative dedicated to developing AI-powered systems tailored for classifying various aspects of mosquito biology, including genus, species, instar, and gender. By leveraging advanced artificial intelligence techniques, MosquitoAI seeks to provide valuable tools for mosquito surveillance and control, ultimately benefiting communities at risk of mosquito-borne diseases. This project collects and analyzes extensive datasets, aiming to automate the identification of mosquito characteristics, which traditionally required expert entomological training. The system's capabilities cover diverse mosquito species and life stages. Furthermore, it has the potential to engage the broader community through citizen science platforms, enabling the public to contribute to mosquito monitoring. With the capacity to enhance mosquito surveillance, MosquitoAI is at the forefront of cutting-edge technology in the fight against mosquito-related health threats.
